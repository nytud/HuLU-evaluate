# HuLU evaluate

`hulu_evaluate` is a library for evaluating and training language models on Hungarian tasks within the [HuLU benchmark](https://hulu.nytud.hu/). It includes support for fine-tuning with LoRA, official evaluation scripts, and provides a leaderboard for benchmarking.

## Features

- **Training on multiple tasks**: Supports tasks like "CoLA", "RTE", "WNLI", "CB", "SST", and "COPA".
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Fine-tune models with reduced compute requirements.
- **Official training scripts**: Provided for training and evaluation.
- **HuLU Leaderboard**: Submit your results to the HuLU leaderboard.
- **Fully Sharded Data Parallel**: Shard and paralellize training of models

## Installation

Installation via pypi

```bash
pip install hulu-evaluate
```

To install the `hulu_evaluate` library for testing and development, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install git+https://git.nlp.nytud.hu/DLT/HuLU-evaluate.git
```

## Usage

Command-Line Interface (CLI)
The CLI provides commands for configuration, training, and submission.

Setting Up the CLI
The CLI entry point can be called with:

```bash
hulu-evaluate <command> [<args>]
```

### Commands include

## Train a Model: Train on HuLU tasks using the train command

```bash
hulu-evaluate --model_name <MODEL_NAME> --output_dir <OUTPUT_DIR> --train_epochs 6 --train_batch 8
```

You can submit your results on the hulu.nytud.hu webpage. The results are created by default in the "HuluFinetune" directory.

## Programmatic Usage

You can also integrate hulu_evaluate functionality directly in Python scripts.

Training

```python
from hulu_evaluate.train.main import Main
from hulu_evaluate.hulu_arguments.train_arguments import Arguments

# Define training arguments
arguments = Arguments(
    model_name="my_model",
    train_epochs=6,
    tasks=["cola", "rte"],
)

# Train the model
Main(arguments)
```

## Command Reference

--gradient_accumulation_steps: default=1 Set steps for gradient accumulation
```

## The HuLU Benchmark

HuLU (Hungarian Language Understanding Benchmark Kit) was created on the basis of the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmark databases. The main purpose of HuLU is to enable a standardized evaluation of neural language models in a simple way while also enabling multi-perspective analysis. It also compares the performance of various LMs on various tasks and shares the results with LT professionals in tabular and graphical formats.
**The tasks and their precise presentation is available on the official [HuLU page](https://hulu.nytud.hu/tasks)**
